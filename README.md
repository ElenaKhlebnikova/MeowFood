# üçΩÔ∏è MeowFood

Welcome to MeowFood repository! This is a web-application which allows users to view a paginated list of meals, sort and filter.
The application also allows to add and remove meals from the cart and recalculate the total price. 


The project is connected to the backend that I've built here: https://github.com/ElenaKhlebnikova/meow-food-backend
